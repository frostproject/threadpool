# 🔐 Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you’ve discovered a vulnerability, please follow the steps below to ensure it is handled responsibly and quickly.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you’ve found a critical security bug, **do not open a public issue**!

Instead, please report it privately:

- Contact directly via Discord: @iceeburr
- Open a private vulnerability report on GitHub

> We will review and respond as soon as possible. Urgent issues will be prioritized immediately.

## 🧠 What Counts as a Security Issue?

Security issues include (but are not limited to):

- Code that could allow unauthorized access or control (RCE)
- Leaked secrets or sensitive data
- Vulnerabilities in project dependencies
- Logic flaws that compromise expected security behavior

> Note: If you’ve discovered a bug that is not a security concern, please submit it as a standard bug report instead.

## 📦 Dependency Vulnerabilities

If the issue lies in a third-party library:

- Please report the issue to the library’s maintainers first.
- Afterward, notify us so we can take appropriate steps on our end.

## ⚠️ Reminder

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it's fixed **may put users at risk**. Please report privately and allow us time to investigate and patch.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!
