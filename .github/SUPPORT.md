## 🙋 I Need Help

If you’re stuck or unsure about something, here are your options:

- Open an issue – The best way to get support and track problems.
- Join the community – Connect with other developers in our community or the Roblox OSS Discord.
- Contact me directly – Feel free to reach out via Discord: `@iceeburr`.

## ❓ I Have a Question

Please open an issue! We love questions – especially from newcomers.

By asking publicly, you help others who may have the same question in the future. It’s one of the easiest ways to give back to the community.

## 🐛 Something Isn’t Working

Found a bug or an unexpected behavior?

Open an issue with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

> We’ll do our best to investigate and fix it. Your report helps improve the project for everyone.

## ⏳ Please Be Patient

We’re a small team of volunteers and independent hobbyist developers. While we aim to respond quickly, some issues may take time to resolve. We appreciate your patience and understanding.
